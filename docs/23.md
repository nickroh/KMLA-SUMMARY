# 23 Managing the Great Depression, Forging the New Deal

## Early Responses to the Depression, 1929 - 1932

The American economy collapsed between 1929 and 1932

The depression respected **no national boundaries**. Germany had preceded the United States into economic contraction in 1928, and its economy, burdened by heavy World War I reparations payments, was brought to its knees by 1929

The legacies of World War I made recovery difficult in two respects

* Britain’s **central bank** was in no position to resume its traditional role in managing the international financial system.
*  Second, the war disrupted the international **gold standard**

### Herbert Hoover

President Hoover believed that

* economic outcomes were the product of individual character
*  through voluntary action, the business community could right itself and recover from economic downturns **without relying on government assistance**

and adhered to **gold standard**

### Rising Discontent

the American vocabulary now included **Hoovervilles**:  (shantytowns where people lived in packing crates)

Veterans staged the most publicized — and most tragic — protest. In the summer of 1932, **[the Bonus Army,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonus_Army)** a determined group of 15,000 unemployed World War I veterans, hitchhiked to Washington to demand immediate payment of pension awards that were due to be paid in 1945

Hoover called out regular army troops under the command of **General Douglas MacArthur**

, who **forcefully evicted the marchers** and **burned their main encampment to the ground**.

## Rising Discontent

### The 1932 Election

**Roosevelt** won the election 

Elected in November, Roosevelt would not begin his presidency until March 1933.  Meanwhile, Americans suffered through the worst winter of the **depression and unemployment** continued to climb

## The New Deal Arrives, 1933-1935

The ideological differences between Herbert Hoover and Franklin Roosevelt were not vast.

Both believed in a balanced government budget and extolled the values of hard work, cooperation, and sacrifice. But Roosevelt’s personal charm, political savvy, and willingness to experiment made him far more effective and more popular than Hoover

### Roosevelt and the First Hundred Days 

Congress enacted fifteen major bills that focused primarily on **four problems**: *banking failures, agricultural overproduction, the business slump, and soaring unemployment*. 

* **Banking Reform**

   The *weak banking* system hobbled the entire economy

   Congress passed the **Emergency Banking Act** (which permitted banks to reopen if a Treasury Department inspection showed that they had sufficient cash reserves)

   A second banking law, the **Glass-Steagall Act**, further restored public confidence by creating the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( which insured deposits up to $2,500 )

  **Roosevelt removed the U.S. Treasury from the gold standard** in June 1933, which allowed the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates

  

* **Agriculture and Manufacturing**

  Roosevelt and the New Deal Congress next turned to *agriculture and manufacturing*. 

  In those sectors, a seeming paradox was evident: **the depression led to *overproduction* in agriculture and *underproduction* in manufacturing**

  - In agriculture the **Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA)** began direct governmental regulation of the farm economy for the first time.

  - In manufacturing, the New Deal attacked declining production with the **National Industrial Recovery Act**[^1] 

    

* **Unemployment Relief**

  The Roosevelt administration next addressed the *massive unemployment problem*.

  In May, Congress established the **Federal Emergency Relief Administration** Directed by *Harry Hopkins*, a hard-driving social worker from New York, the FERA provided federal funds for state relief programs

  

* **Housing Crisis**

   Millions of Americans also faced the devastating prospect of *losing their homes*

   Congress created the **Home Owners Loan Corporation** (HOLC) to refinance home mortgages.

  The **Federal Housing Act of 1934** would extend this program under a new agency, the **Federal Housing Administration (FHA)**. 

  

### The New Deal Under Attack

 Roosevelt turned his attention to the reform of Wall Street

 Congress established the **Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)** to regulate the stock market

**The Banking Act of 1935** authorized the president to appoint a new Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, *placing control of interest rates* and other *money-market policies* in a federal agency rather than in the hands of private bankers.

* **Critics on the Right**

  Such measures exposed the New Deal to attack from **economic conservatives** — also known as the political right

  For its part, the **Supreme Court repudiated** several cornerstones of the early New Deal. In May 1935, in Schechter v. United States, the Court unanimously ruled the **National Industrial Recovery Act unconstitutional** because it delegated Congress’s lawmaking power to the executive branch and extended federal authority to intrastate (in contrast to interstate) commerce

  Roosevelt protested but watched helplessly as the **Court struck down more New Deal legislation**: *the Agricultural Adjustment Act, the Railroad Retire ment Act, and a debt-relief law known as the Frazier-Lemke Act*

* **Critics on the Populist Left**

  If business leaders and the Supreme Court thought that the New Deal had gone too far, **other Americans believed it had not gone far enough**

  The most direct political threat to Roosevelt came from Louisiana senator **Huey Long**

  Long seized almost **dictatorial control of the state government**.

## The Second New Deal and the Redefining of Liberalism, 1935-1938

As attacks on the New Deal increased, Roosevelt and his advisors moved politically to the left

**The administration’s Revenue Act of 1935**  proposed a substantial tax increase on corporate profits and **higher income and estate taxes on the wealthy.** 

> “soak the rich”  [^2]



### The Welfare State Comes into Being

The Revenue Act symbolized the administration’s new outlook.

Unlike the First New Deal[^3], the Second New Deal emphasized **social justice and the creation of a safety net**

* **The Wagner Act and Social Security**

  - The first beneficiary of Roosevelt’s Second New Deal was the **labor movement**.

    *National Industrial Recovery Act* (NIRA) had given workers the right to organize unions

    When the Supreme Court voided the NIRA in 1935, **labor unions called for new legislation** that would **allow workers to organize and bargain collectively** with employers

    It also established the *National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)* 

  -  the **Social Security Act of 1935**, had an equally widespread impact

    The Social Security Act was a milestone in the creation of an American welfare state.

* **New Deal Liberalism**

  The Second New Deal created what historians call New Deal liberalism  

  preserve individual liberty, *government must assist the needy and guarantee the basic welfare of citizens*

### From Reform to Stalemate

* **The 1936 Election** 

  FDR[^4] was never enthusiastic about public relief programs. But with the election of 1936 on the horizon and 10 million Americans still out of work, he won funding for the **Works Progress Administration (WPA)**[^5]

  Under the energetic direction of Harry Hopkins, the WPA employed 8.5 million Americans between 1935, when it was established, and 1943

  As the 1936 election approached, new voters joined the Democratic Party  Many had personally benefited from New Deal programs 

  Roosevelt could **count on a powerful coalition** of organized labor, mid-western farmers, white ethnic groups, northern African Americans, and middle-class families concerned about unemployment and old-age security

  FDR won re-election in the 1936 presidential election with a overwhelming victory over his opponent[^6]

* **Court Battle and Economic Recession**

  - Supreme Court

  - Roosevelt recession of 1937-1938

     From 1933 to 1937, gross domestic product had grown

    >  “The emergency has passed,” 
    >
    >   Senator James

    Roosevelt slashed the federal budget. Following the president’s lead, Congress **cut the WPA ’s funding** in half, causing layoffs of about 1.5 million workers, and the Federal Reserve, fearing inflation, **raised interest rates**

    **These measures halted recovery.** The stock market responded by dropping sharply, and unemployment jumped to 19 percent



## The New Deal's Impact on Society

Whatever its limits, the New Deal had a tremendous impact

 Its ideology of social-welfare liberalism fundamentally altered Americans’ relationship to their government and provided assistance to a wide range of ordinary people: the unemployed, the elderly, workers, and the poor

### A People's Democracy

Democratic aspirations that the New Deal had awakened

* Organized Labor

  * Wagner Act
  * CIO[^7]
  * AFL[^8]

  The CIO helped fund Democratic campaigns in 1936, and its political action committee became a major Democratic contributor during the 1940s. T**hese successes were real but limited**. The labor movement **did not become the dominant force** in the United States that it was in Europe, and unions never enrolled a majority of American wage workers

* **Women and the New Deal**

  Because policymakers saw the depression primarily as a crisis of male breadwinners, the New Deal did not directly challenge gender inequities

  New Deal measures *generally enhanced women’s welfare*, but **few addressed their specific needs and concerns**

  However, the Roosevelt administration did welcome women into the higher ranks of government

  **Eleanor Roosevelt**[^9] worked to expand positions for women in political parties, labor unions, and education

* **African Americans Under the New Deal** 

  A cross the nation, but especially in the South, African Americans held the **lowest-paying jobs and faced harsh social and political discrimination**

  Though FDR did not fundamentally change this fact, he was *the most popular president among African Americans* since Abraham Lincoln. **African Americans held 18 percent of WPA jobs**, although they constituted 10 percent of the population. 

  Black Americans received significant benefits from New Deal relief programs and believed that the White House cared about their plight, which caused a momentous shift in their political allegiance

* **Indian Policy** 

  Indian peoples had long been one of the nation’s most disadvantaged and powerless groups

  **the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934**, sometimes called Indian's New Deal 

  - On the positive side, the law *reversed the* [*Dawes Act of 1887*](https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/us-history/the-gilded-age/american-west/a/the-dawes-act) 
  - However, majority of Indian peoples — some 181 tribes — accepted the reorganization policy, but **77 declined to participate**, primarily because they preferred the traditional way of making decisions by consensus rather than by majority vote

* **Struggles in the West** 

  By the 1920s, agriculture in California had become a big business

  Despite the deportations, many **Mexican Americans benefited from the New Deal** and generally held Roosevelt and the Democratic Party in high regard

  Men and women of Asian descent — mostly from China, Japan, and the Philippines — formed a small minority of the American population but were a significant presence in some western cities

  Immigrants from Japan and China **had long faced discrimination**

  Few Chinese benefited from the New Deal. Until the repeal of the *Exclusion Act in 1943*[^10], Chinese immigrants were classified as “aliens ineligible for citizenship” and therefore were excluded from most federal programs

### Reshaping the Environment

natural resources was a dominant theme of the New Deal, and the shaping of the landscape was among its most visible legacies

Under Roosevelt, the federal government both responded to environmental crises and 
reshaped the use of natural resources, especially water, in the United States

* **The Dust Bowl**

  Among the most hard-pressed citizens during the depression were farmers fleeing the “**dust bowl**” of the Great Plains

* **Tennessee Valley Authority** 

  The most extensive New Deal environmental undertaking was the **Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA)**

  Funded by Congress in 1933, the TVA integrated flood control, reforestation, electricity generation, and agricultural and industrial development

  The TVA was an integral part of the Roosevelt administration’s effort to keep farmers on the land by enhancing the quality of rural life. The Rural Electrification Administration (REA)
