# Industrial America: Corporations and Conflicts

> Carnegie leading the way, steel became a major U.S. industry, reaching annual production of 10 million metric tons by 1900

members of the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers would be **locked out of the Homestead mill**

Locked-out workers opened fire, starting a **gunfight** that left seven workers and three Pinkertons dead

## The Rise of Big Business 

In the late 1800s, industrialization in Europe and the United States revolutionized the world economy.

Andrew Carnegie was right when he argued that, even though industrialization increased the gap between rich and poor, **everyone’s standard of living rose**. In his famous 1889 essay “Wealth”—later called “Te Gospel of Wealth”—he observed that “the poor enjoy what the rich could not before afford



### Innovators in Enterprise

United States became an industrial power by tapping North America’s **vast natural resources**, particularly in the West

**Steam engines** replaced human and animal labor, and **kerosene** replaced whale oil and wood. By 1900, America’s factories and urban homes were converting to **electric power**

#### Production and Sales

After Chicago’s Union Stock Yards opened in 1865, middlemen **shipped cows by rail** from the Great Plains to Chicago and from there to eastern cities

**Gustavus Swift, a shrewd Chicago cattle dealer**, saw that local slaughterhouses lacked the scale to utilize waste by-products and cut labor costs. To improve productivity, Swift invented the **assembly line**, where each wage worker repeated the same slaughtering task over and over

Swift also pioneered **vertical integration**, a model in which a company controlled all aspects of production from raw materials to finished goods

#### Standard oil and the Rise of the Trusts

*No one used ruthless business tactics more skillfully than the king of petroleum, John D. Rockefeller*

 He went into the kerosene business and borrowed heavily to expand. Within a few years, his firm—**Standard Oil of Ohio**—was Cleveland’s leading refiner

**Like Carnegie and Swift, Rockefeller succeeded through vertical integration**: to control production and sales all the way from the oil well to the kerosene lamp, he took a big stake in the oil fields, added pipelines, and developed a vast distribution network

Rockefeller also pioneered a strategy called **horizontal integration**

### A National Consumer Culture 

As they integrated vertically and horizontally, **corporations innovated in other ways**

Companies such as **Bell Telephone and Westinghouse** set up research laboratories. **Steelmakers** invested in chemistry and materials science to make their products cheaper, better, and stronger. **Mass markets** brought an appealing array of goods to consumers who could afford them. Railroads whisked Florida oranges and other fresh produce to the shelves of grocery stores. Retailers such as F. W. Woolworth and the **Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company** (A&P) opened chains of stores that soon stretched nationwide

The **department store** was pioneered in 1875 by John Wanamaker in Philadelphia. 

While **department stores became urban features**, Montgomery Ward and Sears built mail-order empires

By 1900, companies were spending more than $90 million a year ($2.3 billion today) on **print advertising**

### The Corporate Workers

Before the Civil War, most American boys had hoped to become farmers, small-business owners, or independent artisans.

Afterward, more and more Americans—both male and female—**began working for someone else**. Because they wore white shirts with starched collars, those who held professional positions in corporations became known as **white-collar workers**

#### Managers and Sales man

Corporations also needed a **new kind of sales force**. In post–Civil War America, the drummer, or traveling **salesman**, 

They built nationwide distribution networks for such popular consumer products as cigarettes and Coca-Cola. 

#### Women in the Corporate Office

Beneath the ranks of managers emerged **a new class of female office workers**

For white working-class women, clerking and office work **represented new opportunities**

### On the Shop Floor

Despite the managerial revolution at the top, skilled craft workers—almost all of them men—retained considerable autonomy in many industries.

Skilled workers—craftsmen, inside contractors, and foremen—enjoyed a high degree of autonomy. 

As industrialization advanced, however, workers increasingly lost the independence characteristic of craft work.

By the early twentieth century, managers sought to further reduce costs through a program of industrial efficiency called scientific management

**Blue-collar workers** had little freedom to negotiate, and their working conditions deteriorated markedly as mass production took hold



* **Health Hazards and Pollution**

* **Unskilled Labor and Discrimination**

  As managers deskilled production, the ranks of factory workers came to include more and more women and children, who were almost always unskilled and low paid



## Immigrants , East and West

### Newcomers from Europe 

Mass migration from Western Europe had started in the 1840s, when more than one million Irish fed a terrible famine. 

“America was known to foreigners,” remembered one Jewish woman from Lithuania, “as the land where you’d get rich.” But **the reality was much harsher**. Even in the age of steam, a transatlantic voyage was grueling. 

### Asian Americans and Exclusion 

Compared with Europeans, newcomers from **Asia faced even harsher treatment.** 

Facing intense political pressure, **Congress in 1882 passed the Chinese Exclusion Act**, specifically barring Chinese laborers from entering the United States.

## Labors get Organized

In the American political system, **labor has typically been weak**.

#### The Emergence of a Labor Movement 

The problem of industrial labor entered Americans’ consciousness dramatically with the **Great Railroad Strike of 1877.**

Te 1877 strike left more than fifty people dead and caused $40 million worth of damage, primarily to railroad property

Many rural people believed they faced the same problems as industrial workers.

Farmers denounced not only corporations but also the previous two decades of government efforts to foster economic development—policies that now seemed wrongheaded. Farmers’ advocates **argued that high tariffs forced rural families to pay too much for basic necessities while failing to protect America’s great export crops, cotton and wheat**

Te most prominent rural protest group of the early postwar decades was the **National Grange of the Patrons of Husbandry**, founded in 1867

During the 1870s depression, Grangers, labor advocates, and local workingmen’s parties forged a national political movement, the **Greenback-Labor Party**. In the South, Greenbackers protested the collapse of Reconstruction and urged that every man’s vote be protected. 

### The Knights of Labor

Te most important union of the late nineteenth century, **the Knights of Labor**, was founded in 1869 as a secret society of garment workers in Philadelphia

Growing rapidly in the 1880s, the Knights union was sprawling and decentralized. It included **not only skilled craftsmen** such as carpenters, iron workers, and beer brewers **but also textile workers in Rhode Island, domestic workers in Georgia, and tenant farmers in Arkansas**

 In 1886, a protest at the McCormick reaper works in Chicago led to a clash with police that left four strikers dead

Chicago was a hotbed of **anarchism**[^1], the revolutionary advocacy of a stateless society. Local anarchists, many of them German immigrants, called a protest meeting the next day, May 4, 1886, at **Haymarket Square**

[시카고 헤이마켓](https://namu.wiki/w/헤이마켓 사건) [^2]

Te Haymarket violence profoundly **damaged the American labor movement.** Seizing on resulting anti-union hysteria, employers took the offensive.

### Farmers and Workers: The Cooperative Alliance 

In the aftermath of Haymarket, the Knights’ cooperative vision did not entirely fade. A new rural movement, **the Farmers’ Alliance**, 

In 1887, responding to this pressure, **Congress and President Grover Cleveland passed two landmark laws**. 

**The Hatch Act** provided federal funding for agricultural research and education, meeting farmers’ demands for government aid to agriculture. 

**The Interstate Commerce Act** counteracted a Supreme Court decision of the previous year, Wabash v. Illinois (1886), that had struck down states’ authority to regulate railroads. 

The act created the **Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC)**, charged with investigating interstate shipping, forcing railroads to make their rates public, and suing in court when necessary to make companies reduce “unjust or unreasonable” rates

### Another Path: The American Federation of Labor 

In the 1870s, printers, iron-workers, bricklayers, and other skilled workers organized nationwide trade unions.

In the early 1880s, many trade unionists joined the **Knights of Labor coalition**. But the aftermath of the **Haymarket violence** persuaded them to leave and **create separate American Federation of Labor** (AFL)
