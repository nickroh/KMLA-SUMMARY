  금본위제도

  American global supremacy rested partly on the economic institutions created at an international conference in **Bretton Woods**, New Hampshire, in July 1944. The first of those institutions was the **World Bank**, created to provide loans for the reconstruction of war-torn Europe as well as for the development of former colonized nations— the so-called Third World or developing world. A second institution, the **International Monetary Fund (IMF)**, was set up to stabilize currencies and provide a predictable monetary environment for trade, with the U.S. dollar serving as the benchmark.

    The Bretton Woods system was joined in 1947 by the first General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)

## A Suburban Nation

 the American definition of the good life emerged with exceptional distinctness: a high value on consumption, a devotion to family and domesticity, and preference for suburban living

### The Post war Housing Boom

Migration to the suburbs had been going on for a hundred years, but never before on the scale that the country experienced after World War II

 By 1960, one-third of Americans lived in suburbs

* Sunbelt

  Suburban living, although a nationwide phenomenon, was most at home in the Sunbelt (the southern and southwestern states), where taxes were low, the climate was mild, and open space allowed for sprawling subdivisions

  Most dramatic was California’s growth, spurred especially by the state’s booming defense related aircraft and electronics industries
