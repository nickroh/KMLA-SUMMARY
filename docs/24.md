# The World at War

## The Road to War

The **Great Depression** disrupted economic life around the world and brought the collapse of traditional political institutions. In response, an antidemocratic movement known as **fascism**, which had **originated in Italy during the 1920s, developed in Germany, Spain, and Japan**[^1]

### The Rise of Fascism

World War II had its roots in the settlement of World War I. **Germany struggled under the harsh terms of the Treaty of Versailles**, and **Japan and Italy had their desire for overseas empires thwarted by the treaty makers**

**Fascism**, as instituted in Germany by ***Hitler***, *combined a centralized, authoritarian state, a doctrine of Aryan racial supremacy, and intense nationalism* in a call for the spiritual reawakening of the German people



* **Japan & Italy**

  - Japan

    The first challenge came from Japan. **To become an industrial power**, Japan required **raw materials and overseas markets**.

    Japan embraced an **expansionary foreign policy** in 
    pursuit of colonial possessions and overseas influence

     League of Nations~~허수아비~~ condemned Japan’s actions but *did* *nothing to stop them*

  - Italy

    As in Japan, the Italian fascists **desired overseas colonies** for raw materials, markets, and national prestige

  

* **Hitler's Germany**

  Huge World War I *reparation payments, economic depression, fear of communism, labor unrest, and rising unemployment* **fueled the ascent of Adolf Hitler** and his National Socialist (Nazi) Party

  Hitler’s goal was nothing short of European domination and world power, as he had made clear **in his 1925 book Mein Kampf (My Struggle)**. The **book outlined his plans** to *overturn the territorial settlements of the Versailles treaty, unite Germans living throughout central Europe in a great German fatherland, and annex large areas of Eastern Europe*

  The **“inferior races”** who lived in these regions — **Jews, Gypsies, and Slavs** — **would be removed** or subordinated to the German “master race.” 

  **Rome-Berlin Axis**: political and military alliance between two nations

  

  * In 1935, Hitler began to **rearm Germany**, in violation of the Versailles treaty

  * In 1936, he sent troops into the Rhineland

  * **Hitler and Mussolini formed the Rome-Berlin Axis**, a political and military alliance between the two fascist nations

  * In 1936, Germany signed a pact to create a **military alliance with Japan against the Soviet Union**

    
  
   Hitler had seized the military advantage in Europe by 1937

### War Approaches

As Hitler pushed his initiatives in Europe, which was mired in economic depression as deeply as the United States, the Roosevelt administration faced widespread **isolationist sentiment at home**

Congress passed **Neutrality Act of 1935** 

**The Neutrality Act of 1935** imposed an embargo on selling arms to warring countries and declared that Americans traveling on the ships of belligerent nations did so at their own risk. 

In 1936, **Congress banned loans to belligerents**[^2], and in 1937 it imposed a “**cash-and-carry**” requirement: if a warring country wanted to purchase nonmilitary goods from the United States, it had to **pay cash and carry them in its own ships**, keeping the United States out of potentially dangerous naval warfare. 

* **The Popular Front** 

  Other Americans responded to the rise of European fascism by **advocating U.S. intervention**

  In the United States, the Popular Front drew from a wide range of social groups

* **The Failure of Appeasement**

  Encouraged by the weak worldwide response to the invasions of China, Ethiopia, and the Rhineland, and emboldened by British and French neutrality during the Spanish Civil War, **Hitler grew more aggressive in 1938**

  He sent troops to **annex German-speaking Austria** while making clear his intention to **seize part of Czechoslovakia**. Because Czechoslovakia had an alliance with France, war seemed imminent

  But at the Munich Conference in September 1938, **Britain and France capitulated, agreeing to let Germany annex the Sudetenland** 

  Within six months, Hitler’s forces had overrun the rest of **Czechoslovakia and were threatening to march into Poland**.

  Then, in August 1939, Hitler and Stalin shocked the world by signing a **mutual nonaggression pact**[^3]
  
  Two days after the European war started, the United States declared its **neutrality**
  
  The final shock came in mid-June, when **France too surrendered**. **Britain now stood alone against Hitler’s plans for domination of Europe**
  
* **Isolationism and Internationalism** 

   After a bitter battle in Congress in 1939, Roosevelt won a **change in the neutrality** laws to allow the **Allies to buy arms** as well as nonmilitary goods on a cash-and-carry basis

  William Allen White and his Committee to **Defend America by Aiding the Allies**

  Because of the America Firsters’ efforts, Roosevelt proceeded cautiously in 1940 as he moved the United States **closer to involvement**

  - Land-Lease Act

    Britain & Soviet Union

  Roosevelt underlined his support for the Allied cause by meeting in August 1941 with British prime minister Winston Churchill (who had succeeded Chamberlain in 1940). Their joint press release, which became known as the **Atlantic Charter**[^4], provided the ideological foundation of the Western cause

  In the fall of 1941, the reality of U.S. involvement in the war drew closer. By September, **Nazi U-boats and the American navy were exchanging fire in the Atlantic**

### The Attack on Pearl Harbor

The United States responded to the stationing of Japanese troops in Indochina by **restricting trade with Japan**.

**Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in Hawaii**

The hopes and prayers of liberty-loving people everywhere march with you. In company with our brave Allies and brothers-in-arms on other Fronts, you will bring about the destruction of the German war machine, the elimination of Nazi tyranny over the oppressed peoples of Europe, and security for ourselves in a free world.
