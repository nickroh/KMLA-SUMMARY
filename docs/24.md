# The World at War

## The Road to War

The **Great Depression** disrupted economic life around the world and brought the collapse of traditional political institutions. In response, an antidemocratic movement known as **fascism**, which had **originated in Italy during the 1920s, developed in Germany, Spain, and Japan**[^1]

### The Rise of Fascism

World War II had its roots in the settlement of World War I. **Germany struggled under the harsh terms of the Treaty of Versailles**, and **Japan and Italy had their desire for overseas empires thwarted by the treaty makers**

**Fascism**, as instituted in Germany by ***Hitler***, *combined a centralized, authoritarian state, a doctrine of Aryan racial supremacy, and intense nationalism* in a call for the spiritual reawakening of the German people



* Japan & Italy

  - Japan

    The first challenge came from Japan. **To become an industrial power**, Japan required **raw materials and overseas markets**.

    Japan embraced an **expansionary foreign policy** in 
    pursuit of colonial possessions and overseas influence

     League of Nations~~허수아비~~ condemned Japan’s actions but *did* *nothing to stop them*

  - Italy

    As in Japan, the Italian fascists **desired overseas colonies** for raw materials, markets, and national prestige

  

* Hitler's Germany

  Huge World War I *reparation payments, economic depression, fear of communism, labor unrest, and rising unemployment* **fueled the ascent of Adolf Hitler** and his National Socialist (Nazi) Party

  Hitler’s goal was nothing short of European domination and world power, as he had made clear **in his 1925 book Mein Kampf (My Struggle)**. The **book outlined his plans** to *overturn the territorial settlements of the Versailles treaty, unite Germans living throughout central Europe in a great German fatherland, and annex large areas of Eastern Europe*

  The **“inferior races”** who lived in these regions — **Jews, Gypsies, and Slavs** — **would be removed** or subordinated to the German “master race.” 

  

  * In 1935, Hitler began to **rearm Germany**, in violation of the Versailles treaty

  * In 1936, he sent troops into the Rhineland

  * **Hitler and Mussolini formed the Rome-Berlin Axis**, a political and military alliance between the two fascist nations

  * In 1936, Germany signed a pact to create a **military alliance with Japan against the Soviet Union**

    

   Hitler had seized the military advantage in Europe by 1937
