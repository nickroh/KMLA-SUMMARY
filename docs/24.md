# The World at War

## The Road to War

The **Great Depression** disrupted economic life around the world and brought the collapse of traditional political institutions. In response, an antidemocratic movement known as **fascism**, which had **originated in Italy during the 1920s, developed in Germany, Spain, and Japan**[^1]

### The Rise of Fascism

World War II had its roots in the settlement of World War I. **Germany struggled under the harsh terms of the Treaty of Versailles**, and **Japan and Italy had their desire for overseas empires thwarted by the treaty makers**

**Fascism**, as instituted in Germany by ***Hitler***, *combined a centralized, authoritarian state, a doctrine of Aryan racial supremacy, and intense nationalism* in a call for the spiritual reawakening of the German people



* **Japan & Italy**

  - Japan

    The first challenge came from Japan. **To become an industrial power**, Japan required **raw materials and overseas markets**.

    Japan embraced an **expansionary foreign policy** in 
    pursuit of colonial possessions and overseas influence

     League of Nations~~허수아비~~ condemned Japan’s actions but *did* *nothing to stop them*

  - Italy

    As in Japan, the Italian fascists **desired overseas colonies** for raw materials, markets, and national prestige

  

* **Hitler's Germany**

  Huge World War I *reparation payments, economic depression, fear of communism, labor unrest, and rising unemployment* **fueled the ascent of Adolf Hitler** and his National Socialist (Nazi) Party

  Hitler’s goal was nothing short of European domination and world power, as he had made clear **in his 1925 book Mein Kampf (My Struggle)**. The **book outlined his plans** to *overturn the territorial settlements of the Versailles treaty, unite Germans living throughout central Europe in a great German fatherland, and annex large areas of Eastern Europe*

  The **“inferior races”** who lived in these regions — **Jews, Gypsies, and Slavs** — **would be removed** or subordinated to the German “master race.” 

  

  * In 1935, Hitler began to **rearm Germany**, in violation of the Versailles treaty

  * In 1936, he sent troops into the Rhineland

  * **Hitler and Mussolini formed the Rome-Berlin Axis**, a political and military alliance between the two fascist nations

  * In 1936, Germany signed a pact to create a **military alliance with Japan against the Soviet Union**

    

   Hitler had seized the military advantage in Europe by 1937

### War Approaches

As Hitler pushed his initiatives in Europe, which was mired in economic depression as deeply as the United States, the Roosevelt administration faced widespread **isolationist sentiment at home**

Congress passed **Neutrality Act of 1935** 

**The Neutrality Act of 1935** imposed an embargo on selling arms to warring countries and declared that Americans traveling on the ships of belligerent nations did so at their own risk. 

In 1936, **Congress banned loans to belligerents**[^2], and in 1937 it imposed a “**cash-and-carry**” requirement: if a warring country wanted to purchase nonmilitary goods from the United States, it had to **pay cash and carry them in its own ships**, keeping the United States out of potentially dangerous naval warfare. 

* **The Popular Front** 

  Other Americans responded to the rise of European fascism by **advocating U.S. intervention**

  In the United States, the Popular Front drew from a wide range of social groups

* **The Failure of Appeasement**

  Encouraged by the weak worldwide response to the invasions of China, Ethiopia, and the Rhineland, and emboldened by British and French neutrality during the Spanish Civil War, **Hitler grew more aggressive in 1938**

  He sent troops to **annex German-speaking Austria** while making clear his intention to **seize part of Czechoslovakia**. Because Czechoslovakia had an alliance with France, war seemed imminent

  But at the Munich Conference in September 1938, **Britain and France capitulated, agreeing to let Germany annex the Sudetenland** 

  Within six months, Hitler’s forces had overrun the rest of Czechoslovakia and were threatening to march into Poland.

  Then, in August 1939, Hitler and Stalin shocked the world by signing a **mutual nonaggression pact**.
