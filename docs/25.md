# Cold War America

## Containment and a Divided Global Order

The Cold War began on the heels of WW2 and ended in 1991 with the dissolution of the Soviet Union

### Origins of the Cold War

World War II set the basic conditions for the Cold War

#### Yalta
At the Yalta Conference of February 1945, Wilsonian principles yielded to U.S.-Soviet power realities

Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin met in Yalta, a resort in southern Ukraine on the Black Sea. Roosevelt focused on maintaining Allied unity and securing **Stalin’s commitment to enter the war against Japan**

At Yalta, the **Big Tree also agreed to establish an international body to replace the discredited League of Nations**

Based on plans drawn up at the 1944 Dumbarton Oaks conference in Washington, D.C., the new organization, to be known as the **United Nations**

#### Potsdam

At the Potsdam Conference outside Berlin in July 1945, **Harry Truman replaced the deceased Roosevelt**



### Containment Strategy

In the late 1940s, American officials developed a clear strategy toward the Soviet Union that would become known as containment

* Truman Doctrine
* Marshall plan



#### Eastern and Western Europe

* **North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)**

  Under the NATO pact, twelve nations—Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Great Britain, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, and the United States—agreed that “an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all.”

#### NSC-68

 America’s brief tenure as sole nuclear power ended in September 1949, however, when the **Soviet Union detonated an atomic bomb**

 Truman then turned to the U.S. National Security Council (NSC), established by the National Security Act of 1947, for a strategic reassessment

In April 1950, the NSC delivered its report, known as NSC-68. Bristling with alarmist rhetoric, the document marked a decisive turning point in the U.S. approach to the Cold War

### Asia

Korean War



## Cold War Liberalism

Truman and the Democratic Party of the late 1940s and early 1950s forged what historians call **Cold War liberalism**. They preserved the core programs of the New Deal welfare state, developed the containment policy to oppose Soviet influence throughout the world, and fought so-called subversives at home. 

* **Taft Hartley Act**

  weakened the light of workers

* **Fair Deal**: national health insurance, aid to education, a housing program, expansion of Social Security, a higher minimum wage, and a new agricultural program. 

### Red Scare

**Soviet Union**

#### Loyalty-Security Program 

To insulate his administration against charges of Communist infiltration, Truman issued Executive Order 9835 on March 21, 1947, which created the Loyalty-Security Program

#### HUAC (반미 활동 조사 위원회)

The Truman administration had legitimized the vague and malleable concept of “disloyalty.” Others proved willing to stretch the concept even further, beginning with the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), which Congressman Martin Dies of Texas and other conservatives had launched in 1938

#### McCarthyism 

 “I have here in my hand a list of 205 . . . a list of names that were made known to the Secretary of State as being members of the Communist Party and who nevertheless are still working and shaping policy in the State Department.”



### The Politics of Cold War Liberalism 

As election day 1952 approached, the nation was embroiled in the tense Cold War with the Soviet Union and fighting a “hot” war in Korea
