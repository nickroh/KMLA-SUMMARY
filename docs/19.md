# Civilization's Inferno: The Rise and Reform of Industrial Cities

## The New Metropolis

### The Shape of the Industrial City

Before Civil War, cities served the needs of commerce and finance not industry..

Early manufacturing sprang up mostly in the **countryside**

As industrialization developed, **cities became sites for manufacturing as well as finance and trade**

#### Mass Transit

New technologies helped residents and visitors negotiate the industrial city. 

*  electric trolley system
* railroad



#### Skyscrapers

By the 1880s, invention of steel girders, durable plate glass, and passenger elevators began to revolutionize urban building methods

Te first skyscraper was William Le Baron Jenney’s ten-story Home Insurance Building (1885) in Chicago. 

#### The Electric City 

**One of the most dramatic urban amenities was electric light**. Gaslight, produced from coal gas, had been used for residential light since the early nineteenth century, but gas lamps were too dim to brighten streets and public spaces

### Newcomers and Neighborhoods 

**Explosive population growth made cities a world of new arrivals**, including many young women and men arriving from the countryside.

America’s cities also became homes for millions of overseas immigrants

* African Americans began settle in northern cities
* Black faced : race riot -- attacks by white mob



### City Cultures

Despite their dangers and problems, industrial cities could be exiting places to live



* Urban Amusements
  * vaudeville theater
  * nickelodeons
  * music : Blues
  * Sex and the City
  * dating
  * High culture ,, museum libraries 
  * Urban Journalism,, Yellow journalism

### Urban Machines

In the United States, cities relied largely on private developers to build streetcar lines and provide urgently needed water, gas, and electricity

When contractors sought city business, or saloon keepers needed licenses, they turned to political machines

For constituents, political machines acted as a rough-and-ready social service agency, providing jobs for the jobless or a helping hand for a bereaved family

**Political Machine**[^1]

**Middle-class reformers condemned immigrants for supporting machines**. But urban immigrants believed that few middle-class Americans cared about the plight of poor city folk like themselves. **Machines were hardly perfect, but immigrants could rely on them for jobs, emergency aid, and the only public services they could hope to obtain**

Machine-style governments achieved **some notable successes**

These achievements were remarkable, because American municipal governments labored under severe political constraints
