# Civilization's Inferno: The Rise and Reform of Industrial Cities

## The New Metropolis

### The Shape of the Industrial City

Before Civil War, cities served the needs of commerce and finance not industry..

Early manufacturing sprang up mostly in the **countryside**

As industrialization developed, **cities became sites for manufacturing as well as finance and trade**

#### Mass Transit

New technologies helped residents and visitors negotiate the industrial city. 

*  electric trolley system
* railroad



#### Skyscrapers

By the 1880s, invention of steel girders, durable plate glass, and passenger elevators began to revolutionize urban building methods

Te first skyscraper was William Le Baron Jenney’s ten-story Home Insurance Building (1885) in Chicago. 

#### The Electric City 

**One of the most dramatic urban amenities was electric light**. Gaslight, produced from coal gas, had been used for residential light since the early nineteenth century, but gas lamps were too dim to brighten streets and public spaces

### Newcomers and Neighborhoods 

**Explosive population growth made cities a world of new arrivals**, including many young women and men arriving from the countryside.

America’s cities also became homes for millions of overseas immigrants

* African Americans began settle in northern cities
* Black faced : race riot -- attacks by white mob



### City Cultures

Despite their dangers and problems, industrial cities could be exiting places to live



* Urban Amusements
  * vaudeville theater
  * nickelodeons
  * music : Blues
  * Sex and the City
  * dating
  * High culture ,, museum libraries 
  * Urban Journalism,, Yellow journalism

### Urban Machines

In the United States, cities relied largely on private developers to build streetcar lines and provide urgently needed water, gas, and electricity

When contractors sought city business, or saloon keepers needed licenses, they turned to political machines

For constituents, political machines acted as a rough-and-ready social service agency, providing jobs for the jobless or a helping hand for a bereaved family

**Political Machine**[^1]

**Middle-class reformers condemned immigrants for supporting machines**. But urban immigrants believed that few middle-class Americans cared about the plight of poor city folk like themselves. **Machines were hardly perfect, but immigrants could rely on them for jobs, emergency aid, and the only public services they could hope to obtain**

Machine-style governments achieved **some notable successes**

These achievements were remarkable, because American municipal governments labored under severe political constraints

### The Limits of Machine Gov

The scale of urban problems became dramatically evident in the depression of the 1890s, when unemployment reached a staggering 25 percent in some cities

Leaders of the National Municipal League advised cities to elect small councils and hire professional city managers who would direct operations like a corporate executive

### Fighting Dirt and Vice

As early as the 1870s and 1880s, news reporters drew attention to **corrupt city governments, the abuse of power by large corporations**, and threats to **public health**



#### Cleaning Up Urban Environments 

One of the most urgent problems of the big city was **disease**. In the late nineteenth century, scientists in Europe came to understand the role of germs and bacteria

* Epidemic, Disease

The public health movement became one of the era’s **most visible and influential reforms**. 

#### Closing Red Light Districts[^2]

Distressed by the commercialization of sex, reformers also launched a campaign against urban prostitution. They warned, in dramatic language, of the threat of **white slavery**, alleging (in spite of considerable evidence to the contrary) that large numbers of young white women were **being kidnapped and forced into prostitution[^3]**

### The Movement for Social Settlements 

Some urban reformers focused their energies on building a creative new institution, the social settlement.

 Te most famous, and one of the first, was **Hull House** on Chicago’s West Side, founded in 1889 by Jane Addams and her companion Ellen Gates Starr

* YMCA



### Cities and National Politics 

Despite reform efforts, the problems wrought by industrialization continued to cause suffering in urban workplaces and environments.

 In 1906, journalist Upton Sinclair exposed some of the most extreme forms of labor exploitation in his novel ***The Jungle***, which described appalling **conditions in Chicago meatpacking plants**.

Congress passed the Pure **Food and Drug Act (1906)** and created the federal **Food and Drug Administration** to oversee compliance with the new law. 



* NCL[^4]
* Women's Trade Union League
